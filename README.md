It's an old project, and I was a complete novice in machine learning when I did it, but I'm keeping it because I like it.

# flappybird-neuralnetwork-geneticalgorithm-cpp

All the codes were made by me.\
\
The goal was to implement a neural network in the game flappybird.\
\
The project creates an instance of a flappy bird game. Then, it trains a neural network using genetic algorithm.\
